# OVERVIEW
This project will analyze the correlation between the increase in incubators/accelerators and employment levels in the Chicago metro area.
# GOALS
1. Analyze datasets from the Illinois Department of Employment Security and determine the relationship between employment rates and the creation of incubators/accelerators
2. Observe how employment levels change in different sectors
3. Create a simulation for how overall employment rates, as well as employment
rates per sector, will change depending on the number of incubators/accelerators
